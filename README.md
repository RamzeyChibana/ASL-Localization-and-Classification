# ASL-Localization-and-Classification
Localization-and-Classification using keras and tensorflow

<br>
<br>



## How it works
## Classification:
### we used Categorical crossentropy loss function and softmax to classify between 26 class
## Loacalisation: 
### we used Binary crossentropy loss function and sigmoid on 4 the output layer to predict the bboxes after normalized them between [0-1] (like using regression)
<br>

## accuracy
### Val_loss  = 1.08
### accuracy score = 0.8 
### F1 score =0.68
